### ConPlex aims to simplify your Python workflow by providing a configuration model that combines the simplicity of YAML with the functionality of a configuration file written in Python. With ConPlex, you write your config once in YAML, and run a single command. ConPlex transpiles your YAML file into a Python module; making it importable, and fully supported by code completion.
